No-logs policy: Look for a VPN service that has a strict no-logs policy, meaning they do not collect any information about your online activities.

Strong encryption: Ensure that the VPN service uses strong encryption protocols such as OpenVPN or AES-256 to protect your data.

Jurisdiction: Check the jurisdiction of the VPN provider. Ideally, you want a provider that is not based in a country with strict data retention laws.

Independent audits: Look for VPN services that have undergone independent security audits to verify their privacy and security claims.

Kill switch: A kill switch is a feature that automatically disconnects your internet connection if the VPN connection is lost, preventing your data from being exposed.

Leak protection: Ensure that the VPN service has features such as DNS leak protection and IPv6 leak protection to prevent your real IP address from being exposed.

Remember, while a VPN can help protect your data privacy, it is not a foolproof solution. Always use common sense and follow best practices for online security, such as using strong passwords and avoiding suspicious websites.
